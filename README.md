General game playing is an extremely complex challenge, since building a model that is able to learn to play any game is a task that is closely related to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Video games are an appropriate test bench for general purpose agents, since the wide
variety of games allows solutions to use and hone many different skills like control, strategy, long term planning and so on. Designed to provide enough of a challenge to human players, Atari games in particular are a good testbed for incipient general intelligence. In this project, we
aim to develop one such Atari game named, Space Invaders using Deep Reinforcement Learning technique. DRL is a cutting-edge approach at the intersection of deep learning and reinforcement learning, aimed at training intelligent agents to make sequential decisions in complex
environments. The model is run for 10 episodes and has given convincing results
